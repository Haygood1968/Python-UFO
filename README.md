# Python-UFO

### UFO Sightings Case Study
### Career Foundry student project A6
### Advanced Analytics & Dashboard Design
#### Objective
To build an interactive dashboard that will visually showcase well-curated results of an
advanced exploratory analysis conducted in Python.
#### Context
For this Achievement, you’ll select your own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an
exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seem
worth exploring. After developing hypotheses, you’ll use various advanced analytical
approaches to help you test your hypotheses.

The results of your analyses will be presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Data
dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible
and tangible way. Your dashboard will tell the story of your analytical journey and, as such,
needs to contain a curation of the key results you discovered throughout this Achievement.

Note that not all of your results will fit into the dashboard. Any additional analyses you
conducted as part of the project will need to be included in a GitHub repository.
#### Data Requirements
As explained above, you’ll be sourcing your own data for this project. However, in order to
conduct the procedures explored in this Achievement (and develop the necessary skills for a
junior analyst), the data you choose will need to meet some specific criteria. You’ll likely need to
source more than one data set while working through the Achievement in order to meet the
different criteria. It is, however, sufficient to start out with one that will act as your main data set.
The data set(s) you choose must:
- Be open-source.
- Come from an authentic/authoritative source.
- Include non-anonymized column names.
- Be recent (no more than 3 years old. However, this factor is not essential - if you’ve
found a perfect data set for your purposes, it could be older too but more than 10 years
old).
- Contain at least 5 continuous variables (for the main set).
- Contain at least 5 categorical variables (for the main set).
- Contain at least 5,000 rows (for the main set).
- Include a geographical object of some kind: for instance, relating to a country, continent,
or something similar. Data like this contains a column that marks where the observation
comes from. If the information from the data set refers to the U.S., for example, there
should be a column containing the names/abbreviations of the states. This is important
for the geospatial analysis you’ll be conducting (see next requirement).
- In the course of the Achievement you will source a time series data set too, but this
procedure will be explained explicitly in the corresponding Exercise, so you don’t need to
worry about it now.

In summary, the **most important feature** your data set(s) need to contain is some sort of a
**geographic feature**. This means whatever data you collect should refer to countries, states,
towns as so on - generally, anything we could visualize on a map when conducting geospatial
analysis. In Exercise 6.1, you’ll find some suggestions for the type of data to use for this project
based on your professional experience and goals.
#### Analysis Criteria
You’ll be conducting the following analyses in this Achievement (note that not all results need to
be included in the final dashboard):
- Exploratory analysis through visualizations (scatterplots, correlation heatmaps, pair plots
and categorical plots)
- Geospatial analysis using a shapefile
- Regression analysis
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis
- Analysis narrative and final results (presented in a dashboard)
#### Dashboard Requirements
As explained above, your dashboard needs to tell the story of your analytical journey. As such,
you’ll want it to contain a curation of the key results you discovered as you worked through the
Achievement. Based on your findings, you can decide which visuals and procedures are useful
to include. (Note: Anything you don’t include in your dashboard can still be included in your
GitHub repository.)

Your final dashboard must:
- Be designed with a use-case in mind (answering key guidance questions).
- Be created in Tableau Public.
- Be interactive.
- Adhere to visual design best practices.
- Include an introduction page that describes the project (data and purpose).
- Include relevant result(s) of initial visual exploratory analysis.
- Include an explanation for how the results of the exploratory analysis resulted in defining
research questions and/or hypotheses.
- Contain a geospatial component.
- Address the defined questions/hypotheses using advanced analytical techniques. For
example:
- Regression analysis
- Cluster analysis
- Time-series analysis
- Include a results summary page explaining how the results do or don’t address the initial
research questions/hypotheses.
- Include details on the limitations of the project.
- Include a proposal of next steps for further analysis.
#### GitHub Repository Requirements
Your dashboard will be created in Tableau, but you’ll also need to ensure the analysis you
conducted in Python is available for viewers, as well. This will give you a place to include any
steps of your analysis that don’t fit into the narrative of your dashboard. Your GitHub repository
must include:
- Your Python code.
- A logical folder structure.
- Folders and files that have been named following industry-standard conventions.
- Portfolio-ready Jupyter scripts for every task in the Achievement (complete with code
comments, organized structure, and clean, functioning code).
- A README file that contains a description of the project, details of the data source(s),
research questions, and cleaning procedures (from Exercise 6.1 task), as well as a link
to the Tableau dashboard containing the analysis results and a short description of its
contents.
#### Your Project Deliverables
Throughout this Achievement, you’ll be working from Exercise to Exercise to complete your
project. For each Exercise task, you’ll submit a deliverable that directly contributes to the final
product—in this case, a data dashboard. Since you can select your own data for this project,
you’ll begin by conducting an exploration of the data before defining the scope of your project,
moving on to your analysis, then finally building your dashboard.
